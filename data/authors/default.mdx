*Better known as 4n0nym4u5*

## About Me

Hello! I'm a Computer Science Engineering student at [Bangalore Institute of Technology](https://bit-bangalore.edu.in/). Passionate about [Capture The Flag (CTF)](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) events, I actively participate with [Project Sekai](https://ctftime.org/team/169557) and [zh3r0](https://ctftime.org/team/212987). My expertise lies in binary exploitation (Pwn) challenges.

## Areas of Interest

I specialize in Vulnerability Research & Exploit Development, with a keen focus on Embedded Device Exploitation and Linux Exploitation in both Kernel and User Space. Beyond Linux, I'm excited about exploring other targets, including Windows, v8, and Android.

## Internship Opportunities

I was previously intern at [Exodus Intelligence](https://exodusintel.com/) as a NDay Vulnerability Researcher. I am currently open to internship opportunities that align with my interests and skills. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to meaningful projects. You can find my CV [here](/4n0nym4u5-tailwind/static/files/resume_arjun_gu.pdf)
